## Design
### Typography

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used for the following fonts:
- ![Roboto font image](docs/readme-images/Roboto-Font-Pic.png)
[Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?query=Roboto) was chosen for the main body, because it was easy to read and has a good correlation to 
- ![Outfit font Image](docs/readme-images/Outfit-Font-Pic.png)
[Outfit](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit?query=Outfit) which i choose for my Headings.
- Sans Serif was chosen as a backup font, in case the main font is not imported into the website, or there is a problem with the browser.

### Imagery

All Images were taken from pexels.com and unsplash.com. I give credit to them in the [credits](#credits) section. All images are free stock photos. The images selected show kids, woman and men playing soccer.

### Color Scheme

![FC FullStackPlay Color Palette](docs/readme-images/Color-Palette-Project-1.png)
A skincolor variation was used as the background-color for the main body. Slate Blue was used for the Header and Footer. I used two different orange colors for the headings #FAA614 was used for the 1st Heading and #DC8D04 for the remaining heading and suvheadings. The reason for that was, that #FAA614 didn't look good on the Hero Image.
For the cover text of the hero image i used red, because i gave a good contrast to the green of the hero image.
